## This is just fun

Once upon a time, in a far-off kingdom, there lived a beautiful princess named Rapunzel. She had long, golden hair that shone in the sun, and everyone who saw her was enchanted by her beauty. Rapunzel lived in a tall tower in the middle of a dense forest, and she was guarded by a wicked witch who had imprisoned her there. But one day, a brave prince came riding through the forest, and he heard Rapunzel singing from her tower. He climbed up her long hair and rescued her from the witch's clutches, and they lived happily ever after.
